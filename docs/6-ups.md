# Key Use 6-ups & Prioritization

This is a collaborative exercise that helps the team examine moments of great need or great delight in a user's world.

It is helpful to draw things around users, because it leads to a story telling point of view when discussing product. It is also helpful to understand the before after state of the users, and what will be the strongest message to them, prior to deciding exactly what to build. This exercise supports these outcomes.

## Outcome

After this exercise the team should have a prioritized group of scenarios or feature ideas from which the team can begin sketching and content wireframing.

## Method

1. Write "What will they (specific user/persona) DO with this product/tool?" at the top of a piece of paper.
2. Divide/fold the paper into 6 boxes.
3. Set a timer to 5-15 minutes (helps everyone rapidly brainstorm).
4. Fill in each box with a sketch that are different ways to answer the question at the top of the page.
5. Share ideas with others and discuss.
6. Dot vote on the top ideas

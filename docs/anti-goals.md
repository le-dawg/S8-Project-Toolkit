# Anti-goals

A collaborative [exercise](https://awilkinson.medium.com/the-power-of-anti-goals-c38f5f46d23c) that helps you define what you want by first focusing on what you **don't** want. This activity can be focused on working norms for the team or on the product itself (like a Black Mirror exercise).

## Outcome

A list of things the team **does not** want, and an agreement on **how** you will avoid these undesirable things.

## Method

1. Depending on your focus for the exercise, pose one of the following questions to the team:
   - What does the worst possible day/week on this project look like?
   - What does the worst possible version of this product look like?
2. Give the team 5 minutes to brainstorm responses to the question – one idea per post-it.
3. Rotating through the team, have each person read 5-10 post-its out loud.
4. Take 5 minutes to affinity map the post-its and give a title to each group.
   - If there are a lot of groups, you might consider running a quick team vote to prioritize which groups you'd like to focus on.
5. Give the team 5 minutes to brainstorm ways to avoid each of the groups.
6. Discuss each group and come to an agreement as a team on how you will avoid these undesirable things.
7. Formalize the results so the team can continue to look back to them for guidance.
   - If this exercise had a product focus, these might feed into experience principles work.
   - If this exercise was about team/working norms, make sure it is documented and that everyone holds each other accountable for following them.

# Being humans

At being humans, people can share things going on in their lives, or even show and tell something interesting to the group. Frequently, the facilitator also has a particular prompt for the week.

## Why

Teams that play together stay together. Ok, it's cheesy, but being humans together on a regular basis just works. It allows teams to get to know each other on a more personal level and opens up trust. Since Truss is a fully distributed company and works with our clients primarily distributed, meetings like these allow us to form better bonds.

## Method

Sometimes this might just be a group of people chatting about what's going on in their worlds or it might be facilitated by someone with a particular prompt. We leave it up to the group to decide how they'd like to use their human time together.

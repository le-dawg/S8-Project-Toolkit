# BICEPS

Establishing healthy team norms is vital to a well-functioning, productive team that finds joy and fulfillment in their work, building basic trust and creating back-and-forth collaboration.

In order to do that, we need to develop an understanding about each other, our core needs, our strengths and growth areas, and build a foundation of trust.

## Outcome

It's crucial to identify what is important to each person working on this project. By doing that we can understand when these core needs are not being met and clearly communicate with each other if that happens in order to find a way to work together. This is also helpful to do with clients to understand how our project meets or threatens their core needs.

## Method/Process

1. Give everyone some time to read over the BICEPS core needs
2. Each person identify their own person top 2 core needs
3. Beach ball around the group and have each person share their core needs.
4. After hearing this, ask anyone in the group to share their answer to "What happens when one of these feels threatened?"

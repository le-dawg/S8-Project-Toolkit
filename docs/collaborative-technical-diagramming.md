# Collaborative technical diagramming

At some point in a project there will be a need for a systems or feature diagram to visualize the various working and connected parts for the product to function. Instead of a (few) person(s) figuring it out, it is an easier and more understandable task doing it collaboratively on Miro (or whiteboard).

While sometimes this is completed only within a group of engineers, having design and product observe this process may be helpful for them to understand how parts of the application fit together while providing a platform to ask questions.

The most important aspect of this exercise is the real time collaboration.

## Outcome

A diagram outlining the system or feature it describes. It can live on Miro, but also exported to draw.io, Google Drive, Github repo, etc.

## Method

1. Decide that there is a need for a systems or feature diagram.
2. Get on Miro (or a whiteboard equivalent). Start with either a box representing the front end (or stick figure for user) and begin to talk through how the user / FE connects with all the other systems to make the application work.
3. Encourage everyone to add at least one box/part in the diagram in real time.
4. Have one or more people explain the whole journey after it is complete or at a stopping point.

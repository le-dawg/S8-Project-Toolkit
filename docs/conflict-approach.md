# Conflict approach

This conflict map shows examples of unhealthy and healthy behavior during conflict. Almost everyone, even when well-intentioned, will exhibit at least one unhealthy behavior during conflict. Knowing how we approach conflict on an individual and a team level can help us have conflict in a healthy, productive way. We would rather talk about this early so we can have awkward conversations now before we have conflict.

## Outcome

The goal of this map is to help people be more aware of when they are exhibiting unhealthy conflict behavior and understand the productive conflict behavior they should move towards.

## Method

1. Each person take 5 minute to identify an unhealthy behavior and a healthy behavior you have exhibited during recent conflicts.
2. Each person chooses one thing to share from their conflict profile.
3. Remember:
   - Vulnerability can feel scary.
   - However, you absolutely do not have to share anything that feels triggering, overly personal, or otherwise unsafe.
   - Code of conduct
     - Approach each other with curiosity and assume best intent
     - Do not re-share personal information from our peers without explicit permission
     - Be kind

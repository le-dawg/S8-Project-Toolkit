# Content Wireframing

This activity will help you think about the information (content) the users need to accomplish each of the tasks/steps identified in your MVP scenarios.

## Outcome

A foundation of the content required for users to accomplish their goals that you can then use in design studios and other exercises to flesh out the interface.

## Method

1. Write out each task/step that a user needs to perform (this can be done in a google doc with one step/task per page, or in a Miro board).
2. For each step/task, list out the information or content elements that the user would need in order to complete it.
   - It's important to focus purely on the content here and to not be prescriptive about how the information might visually be laid out.
3. Review and discuss as a team!

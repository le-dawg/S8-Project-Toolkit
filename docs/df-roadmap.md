# Discovery and Framing Roadmap

A discovery and framing roadmap helps to align the client, stakeholders, and internal team members on a plan for what we hope to learn, how we'll do it, and in what order it'll happen.

## Outcome

A clear plan for the major stages, goals, milestones, and outcomes of the discovery and framing period.

## Method

1. Use this map to the right as a starting template
2. Adjust columns to match the actual timing of your discovery and framing period
3. Align on goals and outcomes and where they should land on your roadmap. Fill out those details.
4. Once goals and outcomes are solidified, fill in the activity details (the colored bars) to indicate how you'll get there.

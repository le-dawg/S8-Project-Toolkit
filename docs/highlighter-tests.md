# Highlighter tests

Sometimes, it's beneficial to isolate and test the content of a product with users to understand what language is (or is not) clear or helpful. Highlighter tests provide a mechanism for you to uncover this in-person or remotely.

## Outcome

Content that has been tested with users to ensure it's clear and understandable.

## Method

1. The basic premise for this exercise is to give users a page of content and ask them to highlight in green stuff that's useful/clear, and highlight in red/pink stuff that's not.
   - This might mean printing out a screenshot of a wire frame and having them highlight it in person.
   - It might mean presenting content in a Google/Word doc and asking them to highlight it that way
2. Synthesize results

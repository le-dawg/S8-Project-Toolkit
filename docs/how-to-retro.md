# How to retro

The team meets regularly, usually adhering to the rhythm of its iterations to explicitly reflect on the most significant events to have occurred since the previous retrospective (retro), and take decisions aiming at remediation or improvement.

## Outcome

Retrospectives provide a platform to celebrate success and review learnings or failures. Individuals can share their thoughts openly with the team and plan action items to improve upon their process during the next phase of project work. Retrospectives can be done on many levels: personal, with internal team members, or including a client or people outside your organization.

## Method

There are hundreds of different retrospective formats. Each one is aimed at looking at your work in a different lens. Outlined in the [Miro template](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kt0cswE=/?moveToWidget=3074457347900906362&cot=14) are a few resources to get you started with formats that we've conducted at Truss.

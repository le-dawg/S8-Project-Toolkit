# Interactive/clickable prototyping

An interactive or clickable prototype is one that allows you to click from screen to screen and navigate the most common paths through the system. Typically these prototypes are built from a series of static screens linked together with "hotspots" using a tool like InVision, Figma, Keynote, etc.

## Outcome

We build interactive prototypes to validate workflows and UI at a higher fidelity. Interactive or clickable prototypes are faster and cheaper to produce than built software so we can iterate fast and continue to get user feedback.

## Method

1. Create wireframes or higher fidelity mockups in the software of your project's choice (Sketch, Figma, etc.)
2. Link up those wireframes or mocks using a prototyping platform like InVision or Figma
3. Share the link or file for that prototype with your team, user, or stakeholder for feedback

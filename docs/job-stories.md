# Jobs stories

Very similar to user needs statements, job stories add more situational context to articulate a goal for one or more users.

They are built from research with real users, buyers, beneficiaries, nth-degree stakeholders etc. These artifacts take into account their circumstances, motivations, and other forces at work.

They do not describe how people interact with a UI, touchpoint, or solution. Therefore, we don't use the term "user", but rather a more generic "stakeholder" term.

## Outcome

After this activity the team will have a list of well defined job stories that can then be used to begin solution brainstorming.

## Method

1. Using the MadLibs template below, have each person write out statements on post-its based on what the research has shown.
2. Group these statements, like with like, and name the group.
3. You now have a list of job stories.
4. Repeat this with stakeholders, starting with their own and then validating yours that they did not cover

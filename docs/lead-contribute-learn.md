# Lead, Contribute, Learn

Establishing healthy team norms is vital to a well-functioning, productive team that finds joy and fulfillment in their work, building basic trust and creating back-and-forth collaboration.

In order to do that, we need to develop an understanding about each other, our core needs, our strengths and growth areas, and build a foundation of trust.

This activity helps us understand the work areas each person wants to contribute, lead, and learn more about.

## Outcome

Similar to the Superpower and Kryptonite Activity, this helps build trust across practices and teams by communicating areas we'd like to lead or learn, and identifying opportunities for folks to pair up and share skills where those two things intersect. This is a natural input to the [Workstream Norming Activity](workstream-norming.md).

## Method

1. Each person brainstorm and write on a post-it (one color per person) what areas they would like to lead, what areas they'd like to contribute to, and areas they'd like to grow/learn more in.
   - Optional: Can also write down what they don't want to do, just indicate DON'T on the post-it.
2. Each team member shares what they wrote down. (Variable depending on number of teammates).

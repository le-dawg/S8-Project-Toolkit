# Opportunity Solution Tree

We have ideas for solutions and have prioritized them, now what do we do?

We can set up experiments to test out different ways to execute on those solutions. This is a great time to bring stakeholders and users into the process, putting prototypes or proof of concepts in front of them without the pressure of being a complete product or service. All to understand how it meets the needs or pain points we heard, and to give us information on how we can build the eventual product or service.

## Method

1. Write the desired outcome for this project - draw from your contractual language, but also what you have aligned on together as a team.
2. Fill out the opportunities layer of the tree. These are based on the needs you discovered during research.
3. Fill out the solutions you prioritized previously.
4. Have the group fill out post-its around experiments that could be conducted for each solution. There could be more than one experiment per solution.

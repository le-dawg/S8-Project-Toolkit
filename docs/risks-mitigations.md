# Risks & Mitigations

A risks and mitigation workshop is a team-wide activity used to identify things that are likely to derail the project.

## Outcome

The output of this workshop should provide the team with a prioritized list of risks and potential mitigation strategies. The output can also been used to populate a risk register to track risks over the course of the project.

## Method

1. Gather the full team including clients and stakeholders
2. Allow time for each participant to 5-10 risks, 1 risk per sticky. These risks can be from a variety of categories (see examples of categories below)
3. Have participants pick their top 5 risks
4. Go around the group and have each participant explain their risk and plot it on a 2x2 of probability and impact
5. Once all all risks have been mapped, focus on brainstorming mitigation or assigning mitigation strategy for risks that are high probability and high impact

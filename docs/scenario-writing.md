# Scenario Writing

Scenarios are fictitious stories of the users or personas we are designing for. They involve a user performing certain actions or simulations to accomplish a goal. It also involves using a product, service or prototype to accomplish certain goals in their day-to-day activities or otherwise. Scenario stories also help product team members align on user objectives.

## Outcome

A future-state product vision that the team can use to begin adding more fidelity to through content wireframes, design studios, and prototypes.

## Method

1. Imagine our user (we'll focus on one at a time, starting with applicant, SMO, adjudicator, etc.) in their environment, trying to meet the goals we've outlined in Part A.
2. Thinking about their entire workflow, try to list out all the steps they would perform using our blue-sky solution (one step per post-it, without focusing on what's possible, what's the current process, if the role/step exists now or not.).
3. Once everyone has written scenarios out for a user, review and have each person share their scenario, others ask questions.
4. Work as a team to create one master scenario.
5. This becomes our 10 year product vision.
6. Next steps: Pare down into 5 year, 2 year, MVP (increments are flexible)

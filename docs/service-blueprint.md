# Service Blueprint

A map or diagram that visualizes a service. It shows how all of the people, processes, systems, and dependencies work together to provide the service for end users.

## Outcome

- Align interdepartmental teams by establishing a shared understanding of the service.
- Discover critical moments, inefficiencies, and pain points.
- Identify opportunities for improvement, for both end users and the people who provide the service.

## Method

One person asks questions while drawing the blueprint on the whiteboard (physical or digital), the other person answers, then you switch.

1. **Define the service goal of the service you're blueprinting.** What are your end users ultimately trying to accomplish? Your answer is your service goal.
2. **Map the end users' experience.** Note each step an end user will take, from first learning about the service to reaching their goal. Also note the tools they may use to accomplish each step.
3. **Map staff and management's experience.** Add each step frontline staff takes to help provide this service. Note any communication channels, tools, or systems frontline staff uses.
4. **Identify gaps and who you should consult next.**
5. **Engage other teams.** Once you have a solid draft of the end user and frontline staff steps, schedule sessions to fill in details about technology, policy, or operations. These sessions will help bring clarity to additional (and sometimes invisible) parts of the service.

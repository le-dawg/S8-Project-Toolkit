# Solution or Experiment Prioritization

We will have generated a lot of solutions, but **which solutions should we prioritize?** Back to the good ol' 2x2!

This time our axis will help us plot **value against feasibility**

This will help us determine which solutions we can initially experiment with, put in front of users, and then, create a product plan around.

## Outcome

After this exercise you should come away with a prioritized list of solutions from which the team can begin working on

## Method

1. Write down all of your solutions (color coded based on type)
2. Go around the group and have each participant explain their solution and plot it on a 2x2 of feasibility vs. value. If there are any contractual obligations (yellow stickies) make sure to plot those as well.
3. If any questions arise during the session make sure to note them (red stickies)
4. Once the team has plotted all brainstormed solutions you can begin working on next steps for high feasibility/high value solutions.

# Stakeholder Mapping

In a collaborative work session, list out the people who are affected by or have the potential to affect the outcome of this product.

## Outcome

Through this activity, we are building trust and understanding of what is most important to each of us. By laying this foundation, these needs are transparent and we can forecast opportunities and risks.

## Method

1. In a group (can be over a few meetings) made up of stakeholders, Product Owners/SMEs, start to identify all the people and agencies who might be affected by, can affect, or are involved directly or indirectly in your project.
2. Find the connections; this might be a hierarchy communicating decision-making power or a simple categorization.
3. Revisit this map over the course of your project to ensure it is up to date.

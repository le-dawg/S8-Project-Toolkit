# Stakeholder Scale of Influence

From the information you gathered in your blockers, allies, and decision-makers table, you can now plot your stakeholders visually based on their scale of influence.

## Outcome

Stakeholders mapped according to their influence and/or interest so the team knows who they need to monitor vs. closely manage and engage.

## Method

1. Put each stakeholder on their own sticky
2. Using one of the influence maps to the right, plot each stakeholder according to their scale of influence
3. Share this out with the entire Truss team. Reference it (or paste it directly into) your project onboarding document.

# Superpowers and Kryptonite

Establishing healthy communication is vital to a well-functioning, productive team that finds joy and fulfillment in their work, building basic trust and creating back-and-forth collaboration is the focus of many of these team norming activities.

First, we need to develop an understanding about each other, our core needs, our strengths and growth areas, and build a foundation of trust.

This activity helps us understand where people feel strong and where they might need help from their teammates. Remember, sometimes our kryptonite can actually be our superpower.

## Outcome

We start to build trust among team members by being vulnerable with each other and identifying areas where we each might need help or guidance and areas where we can provide help or guidance. A benefit to doing this all together is matching up people who can coach or teach their superpower to those who have listed the same as their kryptonite.

## Method

1. Each person has a section in the activity board where they can brainstorm and write down their strengths or superpowers and growth areas or kryptonite. (5 min.)
2. Each team member shares what they wrote down. (Variable depending on number of teammates).

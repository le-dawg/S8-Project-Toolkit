# Team Journal

A team journal is a way to quickly give a brief overview of what's happening on the project (for INTERNAL USE ONLY). Teams have used team diaries/journals/blogs for past projects to track progress and document decision-making.

## Outcome

It serves a couple purposes:

1. It's good perspective to read back on things and how/why we made decisions, or identify where a problem started creeping up. Don't worry about making an entry every day or having multiple entries per day, this is all great.

2. It's a really great start to a case study so that stakeholders don't have to start from complete scratch and search for relevant docs.

3. For updates, we might be able to just point people to this.


## Method

1. Set up a document in a shared folder accessible to the project team.
2. Each person can add journal entries at any time, just adds the date and their name to their entry.
3. Remember candor is vital, links to external docs are helpful, and it's ok to be informal.
4. Suggestion: set up a reminder on an internal project channel to remind folks the journal exists.

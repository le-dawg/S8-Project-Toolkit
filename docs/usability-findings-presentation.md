# Usability findings presentation

After conducting a usability session you'll want to share your synthesized findings with your team, client, and stakeholders. This share-out can be done both informally and formally depending on your audience. A findings presentation is one of the ways to present findings in a digestible way for a variety of audiences.

## Outcome

A findings presentation allows a variety of people from across your project to gain a better understanding of user centered feedback on potential solutions or particular aspects of your service or product.

## Method

1. Gather your synthesized feedback from usability sessions
2. Create a skeleton presentation template with sections for scope, synthesis, findings, and solution exploration (optional)
3. In the scope section add notes on when the sessions took place, with whom, and what the goals the testing was focused on
4. In the synthesis section link to any of the raw materials such as scripts and raw notes
5. In the findings section add content for what the main findings themes were. This can include screenshots, quotes, video clips, observations, and potential suggestions for iteration. You can also include qualitative data such as error/success rates, time to complete tasks, satisfaction ratings, etc.
6. In the optional solution exploration section add any solution ideas that you've brainstormed in connection with the feedback themes. This can include updated user scenarios, sketches, wireframes, etc.

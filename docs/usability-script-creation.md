# Usability script creation

Usability testing is conducted to validate assumptions on solutions that have been developed by the team. These usability sessions typically use a prototype of the proposed solution that participants will use to complete particular tasks. Before the testing session, a script is written that outlines the session's goals, introduction/background info, and particular tasks that the team would like participants to complete. This script is used by the team during testing to provide a consistent process for each participant.

## Outcome

The outcome of this work is a well organized script containing goals, background, setup, tasks, and wrap up. The script should be easily sharable with your team.

## Method

1. Create a script document and add sections for goals, introduction/background, setup, and tasks
2. Review your prototype and note the goals for the session in the goals section
3. In the background section add notes about recording and any demographic questions you'd like to ask your participants
4. In the setup section provide information about how the tasks will be run, how feedback will be collected, and any boilerplate pre-test notes you'd like to include
5. In the tasks section list each task that you'd like participants to complete along with any questions you'd like to dig deeper into during each task
6. Add any comments or questions to the wrap up section that you'd like to ask participants after completing the tasks
7. Review the script and note estimates for how long you should spend on each section based on the length of the scheduled session
8. Share the testing script with all team members prior to testing sessions, and make sure to print out hard copies for backup or use in areas that technology is not allowed

# Prioritizing User and Stakeholder Needs

At this point, we have no shortage of user needs or stakeholder pain points. What we need to do is figure out which are the **right ones to solve for right now.**

This exercise uses a 2x2 matrix to compare two things: Pain and Cost.

## Outcome

A list of the most painful and least costly needs that the team can prioritize solving for first.

## Method

1. Have each person generate user needs on one color of post-it.
2. A facilitator reads the post-its and asks all participants to determine where it should go on the x-axis, then the y-axis. There will be some discussion around these.
3. Have each person generate stakeholder needs on a different color post-it.
4. Facilitator repeats step 2.
5. If there are contractual obligations, state them as needs on a different color post-it and repeat step 2.
6. Put any open questions on a different color post-it.
7. Post-its in the upper right quadrant (or most painful, less costly) are the needs to prioritize solving for first.

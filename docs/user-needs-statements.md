# User Needs Statements

After initial contextual research has been conducted and synthesized, the team can begin to outline the product or service needs of the key users.

A user need statement is an actionable problem statement used to summarize who a particular user is, the user's need, and why the need is important to that user. It defines what you want to solve before you move on to generating potential solutions.

## Outcome

After this activity the team will have a list of well defined problem/needs statements that can then be used to begin solution brainstorming.

## Method

1. Using the MadLibs template to the right, have each person write out statements on post-its based on what the research has shown.
2. Group these statements, like with like, and name the group.
3. You now have a list of user needs statements.
4. Repeat focusing on stakeholders.

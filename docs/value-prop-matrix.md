# Value proposition matrix

This is a quick and cheap way to get insights and validate multiple concepts or product directions by showing users different types of value prop messages. This exercise can be done in person or remotely.

## Outcome

To help understand user's perceived needs and how they may react to solution ideas.

## Method

1. Recruit your users.
2. Define your value proposition message that clearly conveys the solution.
3. Create a range that will be used to measure each message. Range: 1-5: One being least valuable and five being most valuable or I want this now!
4. Place one range and one value prop on each page and print them for in-person interviewees.
5. Place those pages into a slide deck with next buttons for remote interviewees.
6. Show the interviewee each page and have them indicate if they find each message valuable or not.
7. Analyze the patterns after you've interviewed a good amount of folks and you should have good idea of what people think about each concept or idea.

## Tips

- The real secret to this is to ask "why?" after the interviewee makes a decision on each value prop message.
- Make sure you tell the interviewee that these are NOT your ideas and you have no attachment to them.
- Assure them that the only right answer is their honest opinion.

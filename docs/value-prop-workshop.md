# Value proposition workshop

A collaborative exercise that helps the team examine moments of great need or great delight in a user's world.

## Outcome

It is helpful to draw things around users, because it leads to a story telling point of view when discussing product. It is also helpful to understand the before/after state of the users, and what will be the strongest message to them, prior to deciding exactly what to build. This exercise supports these outcomes.

## Method

1. Have a great persona developed and readily available.
2. Draw six boxes.
3. In each box, draw a Moment of Delight.
4. Split the room into groups of three.
5. Each person votes on the six moments of delight (three votes for each person).
6. Each group tallies the votes and comes away with one winner.
7. Bring the groups together and determine the overall winner.
8. Extrapolate the winning Moment of Delight into a value proposition.

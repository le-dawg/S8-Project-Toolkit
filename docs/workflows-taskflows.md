# Workflows and Task Flows

There's a step between knowing what's important to users from research and designing a product UI. Just like we map out their current workflow/task flow to find painpoints, it's helpful to map out their new or our ideal workflow/task flow and associated logic to understand assumptions and what UI needs to support each step.

## Outcome

We have thought through how a user will interact and move through a system prior to designing all UI elements so we understand our assumptions and logic and all have a common understanding of what we are building.

## Method

1. Think through each step a user will need to take to reach their goal.
2. Note your assumptions, questions, and decision-points or forks in the road where a user could take a different path or there's a hand-off to another user within that workflow.
3. Share in a cross-practice collab session to get feedback.

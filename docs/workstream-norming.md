# Workstream norming

Once the team understands more about each other's areas of depth and expertise you can then begin to think about how to break down common workstreams.

This activity helps to set expectations for who will take responsibility for particular work within the practice or team. It also helps to outline specifics of those responsibilities as well as who they'll be collaborating with most often and challenges they may face.

## Outcome

The goal of this exercise is to set expectations, clear responsibilities, and collaboration lanes for members of the practice or team.

## Method

1. The team identifies the main workstreams for the projects
2. Team members discuss which person is best suited to take responsibility for each workstream
3. The person responsible for each workstream fills out the stickies associated with each category
4. The team discusses the categories and adjusts as needed

_Note: It's easier to do this after you've had a few weeks on the project and have a better understanding of the potential work streams._
